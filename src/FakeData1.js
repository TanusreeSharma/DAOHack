    "Description": "There’s no infrastructure more critical than the network of developers who build and maintain web3. DeveloperDAO was founded as a supportive community to accelerate developers’ impact and keep them in shape: physically, mentally, socially, and educationally. The DeveloperDAO Discord currently has over 15k members.\n\nUntil the release of the $CODE token, membership is gated by the ‘Devs for Revolution’ NFT collection, which enables full access to the community and voting. A recent forum poll and ratifying vote decided that after the token launch, $CODE tokens and NFTs will both enable community access to Discord, but only the tokens will be eligible to vote on proposals.",
