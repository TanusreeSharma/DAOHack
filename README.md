# Tools used
For creating such application, we have used is, covalent for fetching data of DAO holders. For more granular data, such as, addresses who voted for the different proposals, we used data crawling techniques so we can make the DAO networks based on voting behaviors as well. Lastly, we used Graphviz for data visualization.  We used state of art community detection algorithm for DAO user profiles' community networks.
